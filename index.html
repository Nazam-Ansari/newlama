                        Journaling follows a simple process of writing your thoughts without any rules or restrictions. The act of self-reflection and routinely putting one’s experiences, feelings, beliefs, and emotions on paper can do more good than just help you feel better.<br><br>
                        
                        Especially when it comes to self-improvement and leading a mindful life, journaling can be a great tool.</span>

                    </h2>
                    <p class="mindful">Mindful journaling is asking yourself why you feel a certain way and then letting it go out of your head and onto the paper. You question yourself about yourself and get to know your values, your motives, the way you think, and how you feel.
                    <BR><br>
                        You take into consideration more possible outcomes, study your situation, and thus shift your mindset. With the clarity of your thoughts, You stop going in the past, don’t look into the future, and become truly present and mindful of your life.

                    </h2>
                    <p class="mindful">Journaling allows you to openly express your emotions that you usually keep bottled up. You get an opportunity to have full emotional disclosure and vent without ever being judged. This helps you feel lighter. Seeing your thoughts written in front of you in their true form without any edits helps you see the authenticity of your thinking.
                        <br><br>
                        In doing so, you identify your triggers and learn to better handle them. When you write down and figure out the thoughts that are upsetting, you feel happier, calmer, less anxious, and experience overall better mental health.

                        <br><br>
                        You build self-awareness and discover things in your mind that might be affecting your behavior and moods. You make your decisions and explanations more realistic and improvise better ways to achieve your goals. You may find out that the thing you are stressing about might not be that big of a deal and this helps you approach it in a more bold manner.

Every boyfriend, every relationship, her friendships, her work, her family — all of them are dissected on pages. Jen is not the type to get into huge, verbal altercations with her boyfriends; her way of dealing with relationship issues has always been to write in her diary, then have a discussion. That way she always has the upper hand in fights, and never loses control.</p>
